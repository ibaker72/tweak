              <p>These Terms govern your use of services provided by Bedrock Alliance LLC, operating as Tweak &amp; Build. By engaging our services, you agree to these Terms.</p>

              <h2>1. Services</h2>
              <p>We provide web development, design, and consulting services as described in individual project proposals. Each engagement is governed by a separate Statement of Work specifying scope, timeline, deliverables, and pricing.</p>

              <h2>2. Pricing and Payment</h2>
              <p>All pricing is fixed and agreed upon before work begins. Quick Build services are prepaid in full. Custom projects are billed on a milestone basis. Late payments may incur a 1.5% monthly fee.</p>

              <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
              <p>Upon full payment, all custom code, design assets, and documentation transfer to you. We retain the right to showcase completed work in our portfolio unless otherwise agreed. Third-party libraries remain under their respective licenses.</p>

              <h2>4. Revisions and Scope</h2>
              <p>Each engagement includes defined revision rounds. Requests beyond included revisions may incur additional charges. Scope changes after kickoff will be documented and quoted separately.</p>

              <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
              <p>Custom projects: if we fail to deliver agreed scope for a milestone, you receive a full refund for that milestone. Quick Builds include revision rounds; if we cannot meet requirements, we will work to find a resolution.</p>

              <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>Total liability shall not exceed fees paid for the specific engagement. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

              <h2>7. Termination</h2>
              <p>Either party may terminate with 14 days written notice. You are responsible for payment of completed work. We deliver all completed code upon final payment.</p>

              <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
              <p>Governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. Disputes resolved through binding arbitration in New Jersey.</p>

              <h2>9. Contact</h2>
