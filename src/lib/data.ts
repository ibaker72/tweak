  },
  {
    q: "How do payments work?",
    a: "Quick Builds are paid upfront or split into two payments depending on the tier. Custom projects follow a milestone structure: 40% to begin, 30% at the midpoint, and 30% before final launch and handoff. You always know exactly what you owe and when.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do I get the source code and files?",

  {
    q: "What happens after I submit an inquiry?",
    a: "We respond within one business day — usually within a few hours. For Quick Builds, we confirm scope and send an invoice. For custom projects, we schedule a 30-minute strategy call to understand your goals before writing a proposal.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many revision rounds do I get?",
    a: "Quick Builds include 1 to 3 revision rounds depending on the tier. Custom projects include revisions at each milestone checkpoint. We work iteratively with weekly demos so there are no surprises at the end.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a custom project cost?",
    a: "Custom engagements range from $5,000 to $25,000+ depending on scope. Fixed-price proposals always. No hourly billing, no estimate ranges that balloon later.",
  },

    q: "What happens after launch?",
    a: "Every engagement includes post-launch support (14 to 30 days depending on scope). Monthly retainers available for ongoing development and iteration.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is this best for?",
    a: "Founders, small business owners, and early-stage startups who need a professional web presence or custom product built by senior engineers. If you value quality, clear communication, and getting it right the first time — we're a good fit.",
